# Java Development with Voice-Input

This project allows you to generate Java code using voice input. It utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to convert speech to text and provides templates for generating different code snippets based on recognized keywords.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library
- tkinter library
- pyttsx3 library

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install tkinter
pip install pyttsx3
```
# Usage
Run the main.py file to start the application.
Click on the "Generate Text" button.
Speak into the microphone and say the desired code snippet or keywords.
The application will convert your speech into text and generate the corresponding Java code.
The generated code will be displayed in the right section of the application.

## Code Templates

The application supports various code templates that can be generated through voice input. Here are some examples:

- Class and Main Method
- for
- while
- switch
- if
- else if
- else
- try catch finally
- try catch
- try
- print
- interface
- enhanced
- default constructor
- parameterized constructor
- setter
- getter
- abstract class
- method
- static method
